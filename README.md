# 📊 World Layoffs Data Analysis (2020 - 2023)

This portfolio project explores global layoff trends from companies around the world between 2020 and early 2023. Using a dataset that provides information on companies, locations, countries, industries, and the total number of employees laid off, this project aims to uncover patterns and insights from recent layoffs.

## 📝 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze layoff patterns, understand which countries, industries, and companies were most affected, and visualize the data to reveal the progression of layoffs over time.

## 🛠️ Steps and Process

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates to avoid redundant data.
   - Standardized data formats for consistency.
   - Handled missing data by filling or removing blanks.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identified the countries, companies, industries, and years with the highest number of layoffs.
   - Implemented a rolling sum to observe monthly layoff trends.
   - Ranked companies and years based on the highest layoffs to pinpoint key periods and entities.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Visualized EDA findings using Tableau to present clear insights on trends, patterns, and progression of layoffs over time.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **MySQL**: for data storage and processing.
- **Tableau**: for creating data visualizations and dashboards.
